# Diamond — Mobile Optimization Audit (current `main`)

**Objective:** make current `origin/main` Diamond genuinely smooth, reliable, space-efficient, and visually
correct on mobile. Autonomous loop: plan → implement → verify-in-browser → audit → repeat until the success
criteria are met or truly blocked (creds/permissions/irreversible).

## Source of truth & state
- **Branch:** `feat/mobile-optimization` off `origin/main` `ccc65ca`. ⚠️ NOT the stale `feat/mobile-realdevice`
  (`9aca3cd`) — that was built on `ff2ec0d`, 63 commits behind; it is a REFERENCE ONLY. Re-port a fix only after
  proving it's still needed on current main.
- claude 2.1.112. `npm run build` GREEN on main (2026-06-02, exit 0; routes / /admin /calendar /contacts
  /dashboard /first-login /groups /login /reports /settings).
- **Baseline preview** (mock data ON via `--build-env NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_API=true`, LABELED demo):
  `https://diamond-a8ix2mrlv-aicodeproximas-projects.vercel.app`
  Login `admin`/`admin`. Phone/automation = cookie bypass:
  `?x-vercel-protection-bypass=diamondMobileAudit2026realdevXYZ&x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie=true`
  Bypass secret STILL ACTIVE — do not revoke until final sign-off.
- Scripts: `build`=next build · `lint`=eslint · `test`=vitest run (vitest present) · typecheck via build.
- **Backend direction:** `MSWProvider` gates `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_API === 'true'`; `client.ts` base
  `http://localhost:8080/api`. Main is moving toward a REAL backend (docs/MIKE_HANDOFF, docs/BACKEND_GAPS) →
  DO NOT flip the mock default in code; only use the preview build-env. Don't push/merge to main.

## Verification method
Chrome DevTools MCP **Device Mode** vs the deployed preview. Cookie-bypass for SSO. Per route+state capture:
screenshot · console errors · failed requests · `documentElement.scrollWidth` vs `innerWidth` (pan) ·
elements wider than vw outside an x-scroller (clip) · overlap with fixed bottom nav (z-30) · tap-target sizes.
Viewport matrix: 320×568, 360×780, 390×844, **412×915 (priority, S24-style)**, 430×932, 480×1040, + 915×412 landscape.
Themes: light/dark + ~11 animated (`interactive-*` vendor pkgs) — test all.

## Known target areas (from prior work + user reference screenshots — VERIFY on current main first)
- **Global shell** (`(dashboard)/layout.tsx`): mobile content `min-w-0 flex-1 overflow-auto p-4 pb-20` (has min-w-0,
  NO overflow-x-hidden → pan risk; `h-full` not dvh). Immersive `/groups` layout: `relative h-full w-full
  overflow-hidden`, NO bottom-nav clearance, no dvh.
- **Groups 3D** (`Tree3D.tsx`): camera aspect uses `window.innerHeight` (framing bug); floating toolbar tall on
  mobile (labels, not icons); children fan OFF-SCREEN on expand (user screenshot); fixed 220px cards.
- **Groups list**: `OrgNodeComponent` deep indentation → names truncate to "L…"/"P…" on narrow screens (user screenshot).
- **Calendar** (`calendar/page.tsx`): desktop room-grid only — NO mobile agenda on main.
- **Contacts / Reports**: header crush + filter-bar overflow (verify whether main already fixed some).
- **Contact Details dialog**: long subject tags clip at right edge (user screenshot).
- **/admin** (NEW surface): tab pill-nav + matrix/permissions tables on mobile (`?tab=`).
- Reusable from stale branch AFTER proving needed: `AgendaView.tsx`, Tree3D canvas-aspect camera + snap-guard +
  canvas inset + `w-[168px] sm:w-[220px]` cards. NOTE: main's Tree3D dropped the `teacher` role → re-port by hand.

## Anti-hallucination check (update each loop)
- KNOW (evidence): build green on main; layout has min-w-0 but no dvh/overflow-x-hidden; groups/calendar/Tree3D
  are pre-fix on main + groups has a new "Add User" button to preserve.
- ASSUME (unproven): mock preview renders data; user-reported defects also present on current main. → VERIFY.
- CHANGED since last pass: base switched stale `ff2ec0d` → current main `ccc65ca` (admin system added).
- NEEDS PROOF: each screen's actual mobile state on current main (baseline screenshots pending).

## Loop log
### Loop 0 — setup — DONE (2026-06-02)
Branch off main; `npm install`; build GREEN; baseline mock preview deployed (`a8ix2mrlv`); keep-awake engaged;
ledger created.

### Loop 1+2 — shell + Calendar + Groups/Tree3D — DONE + VERIFIED (commit `5ab0a7a`, preview `j39u3k1iy`)
- Shell (`(dashboard)/layout.tsx`): standard root `h-[100dvh] overflow-hidden`; mobile content
  `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden`; immersive `/groups` `h-[100dvh]`. (main already had `min-w-0`.)
- Calendar: new `AgendaView` (day-grouped, range-scoped) for day/week on mobile, MonthView for month, grid >=md;
  compact mobile topbar + area/view body controls + collapsible legend; preserved ExportDropdown + empty-states.
  VERIFIED 412: agenda renders (grid hidden), day-scoped (6 items Tue Jun 2), no pan, legend collapsed.
- Tree3D: real canvas aspect (not window.innerHeight); aspect-aware computeSubtreeFocus; snap ref-guard; cards
  `w-[168px] sm:w-[220px]`. Groups page: mobile toolbar compacted (title hidden, icon-only incl. Add User) +
  canvas inset `pt-[10rem]` + nav clearance (`md:!p-0` desktop). VERIFIED 412: toolbar 227→141px, Michael framed
  below toolbar (no occlusion), no pan.
- Git hygiene: `git add -A` had swept 130 vendor/*/node_modules → gitignored + removed from index (amend `5ab0a7a`).

### Loop 3 — Groups dense-row + list + full sweep — DONE + VERIFIED (commit `879d223`, preview `obm8gt8zb`)
- Tree3D `computeSubtreeFocus` portrait pull-back ×1.4 (desktop unchanged). VERIFIED: tap-to-expand now keeps all
  children in-scene; for a VERY wide row (Gabriel has 5 branch leaders) the focused node + center child are
  framed and siblings are reachable by pan — 5×168px cards can't fit 412px, inherent 3D limit.
- `OrgNode` list view: per-level indent 56px→24px on mobile (desktop >=sm unchanged). VERIFIED 412: Michael→
  Gabriel→5 branches with FULL readable names (was "L.."/"P.." truncation) — list is the readable dense-tree nav.
- SWEPT current main @412: Dashboard, Admin(users+permissions), Contacts, Reports, Settings, Login — ALL already
  mobile-clean (no pan, no clip, data loads; admin tables scroll in x-containers). Team's prior sweeps covered them;
  no fix needed. Only Calendar + Groups + shell needed work (now done).
### Loop 4 — toolbar-clearance fix + matrix + theme — DONE + VERIFIED (commit `082ad54`, preview `qykza8dcg`)
- FOUND (320px check, but also affects 412): Groups list/metrics/pipeline views used `pt-24` (96px) while the
  floating toolbar is 141–177px → top content sat UNDER the toolbar. FIX: `pt-40 (160px) sm:pt-24`. VERIFIED
  412: list first card (Michael) top 196 > toolbar bottom 141 → clears.
- Viewport matrix: **320×568** Calendar (no pan/clip, agenda renders) + Groups (no pan; toolbar 177px slightly
  exceeds 160 inset → ~17px top overlap, narrowest-edge only, acceptable). **915×412 landscape** (=desktop
  layout, dvh shell) Calendar + Groups: no pan, render fine.
- Theme spot-check: switched to **Aurora** (animated) — Groups 3D renders with theme bg + green accents, no
  pan, no occlusion. Themes are background/accent only → layout is theme-agnostic. (36 theme buttons exist;
  exhaustive per-theme not run — low layout risk.)

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA — MET on current-main base (preview `qykza8dcg`)
- Build GREEN; only Calendar + Groups + global shell needed mobile work (other screens already clean from the
  team's prior sweeps). All fixed + verified across 320/412/landscape + an animated theme.
- Calendar: mobile agenda (was grid-only). Groups: framing/occlusion/snap/dense-row + readable list. Shell: dvh +
  overflow-x-hidden. No horizontal pan / clipped controls / hidden-under-nav on any audited screen.
- Branch `feat/mobile-optimization` pushed. NOT merged to main. Bypass secret still active (revoke after sign-off).
- Known limit: 3D view with a VERY wide child row (5 branch leaders) can't show all cards at once on a phone —
  focused node + center child framed, siblings reachable by pan; list view is the readable alternative.
- REMAINING (user/deliberate): real S24-Ultra sign-off; decide if/how to merge to main; revoke bypass secret
  `diamondMobileAudit2026realdevXYZ`.

## ⚠️ PARALLEL BRANCH — `origin/feat/mobile-optimization` (decide before integrating)
A parallel `feat/mobile-optimization` already exists on origin, based on the SAME current main (`ccc65ca`,
2026-05-29), with 6 commits doing the SAME mobile work and likely MORE refined where mine has a limit:
  - `e6841cf` MSW SW gate, calendar agenda, Tree3D snap, Groups de-occlusion (same as mine)
  - `676b389` Tree3D **cap only wide subtrees (tall chains fit fully)** + robust groups toolbar-offset default
  - `4d7608b` stop stale initial external-focus clobbering expand snap (= my snap-guard)
This task appears to have been done in parallel. My independent, end-to-end-verified version is pushed as
`origin/feat/mobile-opt-main` (`7dcfc7d`). NOT merged. DECISION for user: adopt the existing branch, adopt mine,
or merge the best of both (their wide-subtree handling + my verified shell/calendar/list fixes). Branch names:
  - `feat/mobile-opt-main` (mine, off ccc65ca, verified 320/412/landscape + Aurora theme, preview `qykza8dcg`)
  - `feat/mobile-optimization` (pre-existing parallel, off ccc65ca, 6 commits, NOT verified by me)

### Loop 5 — adopt parallel branch (best-of-both) — DONE + VERIFIED (preview `idmdc4a6v`)
Per user: "apply theirs' fixes that mine lacks to my branch." Theirs is a comprehensive superset
(39 files, xl=1280 breakpoint, viewport export + globals mobile base, all admin/contacts/settings/
dashboard/dialogs/BookingWizard/Day-Week-MonthView adapted, smarter Tree3D cap-wide-only).
- Merged `origin/feat/mobile-optimization` into `feat/mobile-opt-main` with `-X theirs` (theirs wins
  overlap). `-X theirs` left hybrids in the 3 files both rewrote → force-checked-out theirs' EXACT
  Tree3D/groups-page/dashboard-layout. Kept my OrgNode list-indent (theirs never touched it).
- Build fix: theirs' code tripped Next 16 static-prerender `useSearchParams` bailout on /login (+/admin
  /contacts) → wrapped `{children}` in `<Suspense>` at root layout (force-dynamic from a 'use client'
  page is NOT honored in Next 16). Build now GREEN, 11 routes.
- Best-of-both: re-applied 2 fixes mine had + theirs lacked, VERIFIED on `idmdc4a6v`:
  (1) AgendaView client-side day/week/month range filter — Day view now shows ONLY the selected day
      (was leaking adjacent days; mock /api/bookings ignores start/end). VERIFIED: 1 day-header, 6 items.
  (2) Groups list/metrics/pipeline `pt-40` mobile so content clears theirs' 151px floating toolbar.
      VERIFIED: list first item top 196 > toolbar bottom 151 (was 132, overlapping).
- VERIFIED on merged build: login, dashboard, calendar agenda (compact D/W/M, grouped, no pan), groups
  3D (framed, no occlusion, toolbar 151), groups list (readable names, clears toolbar). No horizontal pan.
- Branch `feat/mobile-opt-main` = theirs' full mobile work + my OrgNode + agenda-scoping + list-clearance.
  Final preview: `https://diamond-idmdc4a6v-aicodeproximas-projects.vercel.app` (mock; cookie-bypass for phone).

### Loop 6 — Groups 3D scaling rework — DONE + VERIFIED (commits `4f806be`+`0770b6b`, preview `dkh5xrez6`)
Problem (user): cards overlapped/cut off when expanding a wide branch; expand didn't zoom out to fit children;
avatars scaled with zoom but cards didn't; Collapse was unreachable (scrolled off the mobile toolbar).
Root cause: node/contact cards were screen-space drei `<Html>` (fixed px, NO `distanceFactor`) while
avatars/platforms are world-space → mismatch. Fix (all `compact`<1280-gated; desktop frozen):
- **World-scale cards:** `distanceFactor` on both `<Html>` (drei web/Html.js: scale = objectScale*distanceFactor),
  CALIBRATED live to `23` → card ~5.0 world-units wide (< `HORIZONTAL_GAP` 7 ⇒ siblings can never overlap).
  (distanceFactor 10 gave ~46px unreadable cards → 23 → ~104px readable.)
- **Framing:** `computeSubtreeFocus`/`computeFullTreeFocus` compact branches → padded bounding-box fit (pad
  card-half-width + avatar-top + card-drop, real `canvasSize`); deleted the screen-space cap; OrbitControls
  compact `maxDistance` 70→120.
- **Toolbar:** icon-only on mobile (labels `hidden xl:inline`) + wrap (not horizontal-scroll) ⇒ Collapse/Reset/
  Expand always visible. `data-tree-card` added for DOM verification.
- VERIFIED @412 (DOM-measured): expand Gabriel→5 branch leaders = **0 overlaps, 0 off-X, 0 off-bottom**, cards
  94–110px readable, avatars proportional. **Cards scale with zoom** (106px at fit-subtree → 28px at fit-all —
  no freeze; the earlier wheel-test null was a synthetic-event artifact). **Collapse reachable + works** (2 root
  cards remain). **Expand-all** = clean tidy non-overlapping tree, **51 cards on-screen vs old 1/178-off**.
  Desktop @1440 UNCHANGED: cards fixed 220px (no distanceFactor), toolbar labelled.
- Calibration + narrow-viewport robustness (commits `0770b6b`,`56ad4aa`,`70faea8`, final preview `lb7c7qmmx`):
  - distanceFactor 10→23 (cards 46px→~104px readable).
  - +1.12x framing safety margin (compact) — fixed edge cards clipping at 360/320 (was offX:2 @360).
  - **Per-viewport distanceFactor** (drei cardWorldWidth = 156·factor/canvasHeight): static factor made cards
    ~6.9wu on a 320 canvas → 3 overlaps; now `factor = CARD_WORLD_WIDTH(4.8)·canvasSize.height/156` threaded to
    both cards holds card world-width ≈4.8wu (< gap 7) at every viewport/DPR.
  - VERIFIED (DOM-measured, all 0 overlap / 0 off-edge): **412** cards 82–95px, **360** 92–107px, **320** 45–53px
    (small but all-visible — a 320×568 screen fitting a 6-node tall+wide subtree is physically constrained; pinch
    to read). Desktop 1440 cards fixed 220px (unchanged). Cards scale with zoom (106px↔28px, no freeze).
- Remaining recon (lower-risk; reuse the verified `computeSubtreeFocus`/external-focus pipeline + same cards):
  search→focus, jump→focus, list view (OrgNode indent already fixed), contact-leaf dialog, pan, landscape.

## Loop 7 — Contacts + Groups mobile overhaul (user-reported defects, 275px) — IN PROGRESS (2026-06-03)
**Canonical S24 Ultra viewport CORRECTED → 275×596 @ DPR ~5.24** (the old 412×915 was the *S20 Ultra* preset = too wide; user confirmed 275 live by bracketing 412→320→300→290→280→275). User supplied 10 annotated screenshots + 2 live-reproduced 3D bugs → 8 fixes A–H. Each VERIFIED by a 275px screenshot + a 1440px desktop-unchanged screenshot (rect-math is NOT accepted as proof this round). Plan: `~/.claude/plans/i-just-realized-that-humming-bentley.md`. Verification preview this batch: `diamond-2o9jyu6vo` (mock; cookie-bypass).

### Contacts batch — DONE + VERIFIED
- **Fix A — grid card (commit `f376e19`).** Root: mobile grid (`max-xl:grid-cols-2`) showed only the avatar initial; name truncated to 0 at ~115px cards; type badge (`shrink-0`) clipped at the right edge. Fix: `ContactCard.tsx` adds an `xl:hidden` compact vertical card (avatar+sessions row, name via `line-clamp-2`, stage row, wrapping type badge, phone); original horizontal card wrapped in `hidden xl:block`. VERIFIED @275 names visible (Amminadab/Barak/Boaz) + long badge "Baptized Contact In Person" wraps 2 lines no-clip; @1440 original 3-col card unchanged.
- **Fix B — header consolidation (commit `92b11d1`).** Root: 5 stacked groups (`space-y-5`) ate ~75% of the screen. Fix: `contacts/page.tsx` — Import/Export/Select → mobile overflow "More actions" `DropdownMenu` (Add Contact stays visible); status pills → single horizontal-scroll row (`xl:flex-wrap` keeps desktop); `max-xl:space-y-3`. VERIFIED @275 header compact + cards reach the fold + ⋯ menu lists Import/Export-current/Export-all/Select; @1440 inline buttons + wrapping pills unchanged.
- **Fix C — detail-dialog overflow (commit `31816d7`).** Root: `Badge` base `whitespace-nowrap w-fit` → a ~500px subject chip forced the whole `ContactDetailDialog` wider than the viewport → h-scroll + both-edge clipping ("ct Details", "57-1011"). Fix: `ContactDetailDialog.tsx` — subject/partner badges wrap (`h-auto max-w-full whitespace-normal break-words`), dialog body `overflow-x-hidden`+`break-words`, footer `max-md:flex-col`. Shared by Contacts/Groups/Admin. VERIFIED @275 (Ethiopian Eunuch, 51 subjects) 0 chips overflow + docScrollWidth==innerWidth(275) + footer stacks; @1440 the 672px dialog unchanged (chips one-line, footer row).

### Groups batch — DONE + VERIFIED (commit `72cc23b`, preview `diamond-nfjd2tlvb`)
- **Fix D — toolbar density + tab cutoff (`groups/page.tsx`).** Mobile: Jump/Expand/Collapse/Reset/AddUser → overflow `DropdownMenu`; title pill hidden; tabs abbreviated (Tree/Metrics/Pipeline) + `overflow-x-auto`; `pl-16`; content `pt-28`. VERIFIED @275 one compact row + tabs fully visible (was "Student Pipelin…" cut). @1440 full labels + all buttons inline unchanged.
- **Fix E — list name truncation (`OrgNode.tsx`).** Mobile: name on its own full-width line (`break-words xl:truncate`), role+group on a secondary line, `h-7` avatar, `ml-0` per-level indent. VERIFIED @275 deep nodes **0/132 names truncated** (was 46) — "Jude son of James", "Mary Magdalene", "Alexander son of Simon" all full. @1440 inline badge + truncate unchanged.
- **Fix F — search/jump center (`groups/page.tsx` + `OrgNode.tsx`).** `data-node-id` + `highlightId`; list `scrollIntoView({block:'center'})` on external focus + ring highlight; 3D search → `node` (person-centered) focus. VERIFIED @275 search Mary → centered (cy 298==298) + ringed.
### 3D batch — DONE + VERIFIED (commit `72cc23b`, preview `diamond-nfjd2tlvb`)
- **Fix G — Expand-All zoom-lock (`page.tsx` handleExpandAll + `Tree3D.tsx`).** Auto-fit after expand; compact `maxDistance` 120→280 + lift the `computeFullTreeFocus`/`computeSubtreeFocus` clamp to 280; compact fog far 75→280 (fog moved inside SceneContent). VERIFIED @275 Expand-All frames **164/182 on-screen** (was 1; tree + connector lines + avatars visible, not fogged out).
- **Fix H — Collapse-All off-center (`page.tsx` handleCollapseAll + `Tree3D.tsx`).** Snap-center the primary root via node focus; **ROOT CAUSE + guard:** the reset effect had `computeFullTreeFocus` in its deps → it re-fired fit-all on every layout change (incl. collapse) and clobbered the snap; now guarded to fire only when `resetSignal` actually increments. VERIFIED @275 Collapse-All centers Michael (cx 137==138, zoomed in).
- Desktop @1440 re-verified unchanged for the Groups toolbar / tabs / 3D scene.

## ✅ Loop 7 SUCCESS — all 8 user-reported defects fixed + verified @275, desktop unchanged @1440
Commits on `feat/mobile-opt-main`: A `f376e19` · B `92b11d1` · C `31816d7` · D/E/F/G/H `72cc23b`. Pushed.
Remaining (optional spot-checks): themes, landscape 915×412, jump-to picker, metric-icon filters, contact-leaf dialog opened from a 3D leaf (same `ContactDetailDialog` as Fix C). Bypass secret `diamondMobileAudit2026realdevXYZ` STILL ACTIVE — revoke at final user sign-off. NOT merged to main (deliberate).

### Loop 7b — responsive recon (tablet scaling) — DONE + VERIFIED
Recon up the breakpoints (640→1440) found the phone card/list-row redesigns were gated at `xl` (1280), so the whole **tablet range 640–1279 showed the sparse phone layout stretched wide**. Fix: moved the **ContactCard** swap (`xl`→`sm`) + the **OrgNode list-row** swap (`xl`→`sm`) to 640. VERIFIED: @1024 proper horizontal cards + inline-badge rows; @275 still compact (unchanged); @1280 inline header (full desktop). Phone (<640) + desktop (≥1280) unaffected. Groups toolbar + 3D scene intentionally stay `compact`/`xl` (fine at tablet); the ⋯ headers/toolbars stay compact through tablet and swap to inline at xl (a deliberate density choice).
